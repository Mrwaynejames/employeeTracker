## Description 
Companies large or small have employees. Keep track on an entire staff can be difficult. This program allows the user to see how many employees there are, what department, what role, their salary. If there is an postion change you can easily select the employee and their new role from a drop down list. 

## Usage
To use this program type "node index.js" into your terminal to start the program. From there just answer the prompts according to your needs. When you have completed your task you will be shown a table that reflects what you've done and takes you back to the begining prompts.
